        <h1>World Cup News</h1>

        <p>The biggest scorline in the history of the <strong>FIFA World Cup</strong> qualifires - and indeed in the history of international football
            - was recorded on 11 April 2001, when Australia beat America Samoa 31-0.
        </p>

        <p>
            The legendary match also brought global renown for
            <em>Archie Thompson</em>, whose 13 goal haul set a new world record, which stands to this day, for an individual
            player in a single international match.
        </p>

        <p>
            And though the defeat earned the American Samoa ignominy, so inspiring has their subsequent recovery been that it is not
            the subject of an acclaimed documentary,
            <em>'Next Goal Wins'</em>, showing across the world.
